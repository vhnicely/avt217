  <p> This website immediately opens a little popup which tells you more about the restaurant. I both like and dislike this. I like it because it's unique and it tells you more about the website, but I don't like it because I'm not a fan of popups. I think the overall way the website looks is really cool, I like all the pictures and the minimalist text. I also like the color scheme. However I don't really like the fact that it starts off introducing you to employees, I think that doesn't really communicate what kind of food they serve. You have to scroll down to see what food they serve. A problem with how minimal it is is also how few information gets communicated. </p>

	<p> This one also opens with a popup, which I have the same feelings about as I did the other one. I really like how the page is full of colorful pictures of food, I think it makes you want to go there. I also like the navigation. I also think the way the page loads when you scroll is cool, it loads with a white flash in the small area that needs to load. I also like the color scheme.</p>
