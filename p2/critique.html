  <p> This website immediately opens a little popup which tells you more about the restaurant. I both like and dislike this. I like it because it's unique and it tells you more about the website, but I don't like it because I'm not a fan of popups. I think the overall way the website looks is really cool, I like all the pictures and the minimalist text. I also like the color scheme. However I don't really like the fact that it starts off introducing you to employees, I think that doesn't really communicate what kind of food they serve. You have to scroll down to see what food they serve. A problem with how minimal it is is also how few information gets communicated. </p>
