	<p>I decided to try to look at more game design portfolios since my major is Game Design. I feel like you can get a feeling of the aesthetics of his games from what you see immediately opening the page. He also has a writing portfolio, which includes documents he wrote. I do feel like maybe the writing portfolio page could use some pictures or color. His website is easy to navigate and I like the overall look of it. I also feel like he should have included a picture of himself or his work, or somehting like that on his about page. Other than the fact that I feel like it needs more pictures, I like the way it looks and it's easy to use. </p>

	<p>I like the overall look of this page. I really like the black background, I feel like it's easy on the eyes and makes the color of the work itself stand out. I also like that the navigation is on the side. It's easy to navigate his website and he has a lot of content. You can tell what his art style is and what all he can do, and you can also tell what he's better at than other things that might be on his portfolio since there is so much. I like that he has a picture on his website. I was told in my porftolio prep class that you should never make it so that employers have to contact you through the website, you should always have an email address or phone number. So, I think he shouldn't have the option to contact him through the website.</p>

	<p>While I like the minimal look of the webpage as soon as you open it, I feel like it doesn't really convey what his work looks like at first, you have to click around to see anything. I like the way you navigate through his work though, that you just click arrows to look through his stuff. I like that he has videos/gifs to watch. He also clearly tells you what he worked on. He's also got a lt of content on there, and an area at the bottom if you want to click on a specific thing. I feel like the are at the bottom with all the icons is a good idea so if you want to look at something specific you don't have to click through a bunch of stuff to get to it. He also has a picture of himself and a biography, as well as places to contact him. Overall I feel like this is a very good portfolio, in looks as well as being easy to navigate.</p>
	<h1><a href="http://hugo.fyi/#">Hugo Peters</a></h1>

	<p>When you first open the homepage, the entire screen is full of a video that moves to the top so you can look at the about me text. I both like and dislike that, I feel like it's a cool thing to do but the video is pretty low quality and you can see individual pixels. I do think that it shows some good stuff though. As you scroll down there's more work. I like the color scheme of the website. It does take a few seconds to load, and if you try to click on something it also takes a while to load. When you do click on something, it's sort of confusing what exactly you're looking at. Other than that I like that under each project he clearly states what his contributions to the project were. Overall I mostly like it, I just feel like the loading time is a downside and that maybe there shouldn't be a huge video playing as soon as you open the website.</p>

	<p>I like that there's a lot of portfolio work to look at right when you open the page. As soon as you open it, you can see exactly what she does and what her work looks like. I also like that when you hover over a picture, it tells you what it is. When you click on it, you can see more of that type of art. I think her about page looks good, I like that she includes what awards she's won to prove her credibility. She also has the thing where you can contact her directly from the website, which I don't really like since it's not a good way to let people contact you. I also think she probably shouldn't have a log option, while it does show her most recent stuff I feel like we don't really need that. I also think she might have too many subcategories of photography. There's 8 tabs in her sidebar for photography when all we really need is one and they can be divided up by country on the page itself.</p>
