	<h4>What I like about it:</h4>
<p>I sort of like bad website design like this, I feel like aesthetically they can be pretty interesting. I feel like this one especially has a sort of interesting look aesthetically especially because of the content it has. </p>
	<h4>What I don’t like about it: </h4>
<p>The colors are too saturated and there are too many of them. How long the website scrolls isn’t great either, it scrolls for a very long time. Also at the end of the website, there’s just a bunch of links and nothing else, which you don't know exactly where they will lead or even if they'll give you a virus. The colors used in the background also make it hard to read any of the text as it is a very similar color. Aesthetically the website is very confusing to look at and it's hard to tell where the links will go or what the website is even about. </p>

	<h4>What I like about it: </h4>
<p>I really like the moving background you see as soon as you open the website. I feel like the website clearly communicates what it’s trying to advertise and there’s not too much text. It’s also not a super long webpage like the first one. I also like the color scheme. I feel like the minimalist style works really well and I like how the pictures get bigger when you hover over them. </p>
	<h4>What I don’t like about it:</h4>
<p>One thing I don’t really like is how you can’t immediately tell what the website is advertising, there’s just a huge sign up button without showing you what you’re signing up for. All you see is “put collaboration at your fingertips”, but you don’t see exactly what it’s supposed to be advertising. </p>
