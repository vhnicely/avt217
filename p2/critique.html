	<h1><a href="https://www.barcrenn.com/"> Bar Crenn </a></h1>

  <p> This website immediately opens a little popup which tells you more about the restaurant. I both like and dislike this. I like it because it's unique and it tells you more about the website, but I don't like it because I'm not a fan of popups. I think the overall way the website looks is really cool, I like all the pictures and the minimalist text. I also like the color scheme. However I don't really like the fact that it starts off introducing you to employees, I think that doesn't really communicate what kind of food they serve. You have to scroll down to see what food they serve. A problem with how minimal it is is also how few information gets communicated. </p>
 
	<h1> <a href="https://www.jeffreysgrocery.com/"> Jeffrey's Grocery</a></h1>

	<p> This one also opens with a popup, which I have the same feelings about as I did the other one. I really like how the page is full of colorful pictures of food, I think it makes you want to go there. I also like the navigation. I also think the way the page loads when you scroll is cool, it loads with a white flash in the small area that needs to load. I also like the color scheme. I also jus think the whole website looks really professional and cool, and I also just really like the colors thorughout the whole website.</p>
	
	<h1><a href="https://www.wearevibrant.com/"> Vibrant </a> </h1>

	<p> I like the way this website looks. I really like the way their logo looks. However a problem I have like Bar Crenn is how it doesn't really tell you much immediately, you have to click around. I do like the way the navigation looks though, I think the whole website looks very clean. Also similarly to the Jeffrey's Grocery website, I like how things load, they have a bit of a delay when you scroll. I also think that other webpages are really well designed. The entire website is really clean and easy to navigate. This website didn't open with a popup, which I do like.</p>
	
	<h1><a href="https://www.milksugarlove.com/"> Milk Sugar Love</a></h1>
	<p><img src="img/Screen Shot 2019-09-17 at 3.37.46 PM.png" alt="Milk Sugar Love homepage" width="50%"></p>
	<p> I really like the aesthetics on this website. I like the way the picture changes as you stay on the homepage, and it gives you an idea of what kind of food you can get there. I also really like the pinks and purples. The logo also looks cool. I think it's nice how you can hover over images and they get slightly larger. I feel like all of the pages on the website are cute looking, especially with the color palate and the fonts. It also does remind me of ice cream. Altogether I really like the way this website looks. My only problem would be the popup at the beginning, I don't like having to exit out of a popup.</p>
	
	<h1><a href="https://www.hhrooftopbar.com/"> Hive and Honey</a></h1>
	<p><img src="img/Screen Shot 2019-09-17 at 3.43.45 PM.png" alt="Hive and Honey Homepage" width="50%"></p>
	<p> At first glance I really like this website. I like the color scheme and I really like the logo. I think that the pictures on the homepage are able to communicate the feeling of the restaurant well. I feel like the menu section is really well done, I like the way that the background has a pattern so it's not just solid white. I also like that the items aren't side by side, they're off a little bit. I also like how on the menu page the bee logo is moving up and down, I feel like that's a nice touch that adds a little life to the page. I also really like the phrase "come get buzzed", I feel like that's a really clever pun.</p>
